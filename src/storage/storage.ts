// storage.ts — the storage-provider seam.
//
// IStorage is the universal, file-system-shaped contract a project is persisted
// through. It is ROOTED at a project: every path is project-relative (POSIX
// `/` separators inside the interface; a backend translates to its own scheme),
// and the empty string '' addresses the root. This lets a project live on the
// local disk today and a REST/cloud/network backend later without the project
// or document code knowing which — they only ever see relative paths.
//
// A host supplies the concrete backend (a desktop app over its file system, a
// web app over a network API, a test with an in-memory map — see FakeStorage).

// One entry in a directory listing — mirrors the low-level FileEntry but is the
// storage-layer shape consumers bind to (kept separate so IStorage owns its
// vocabulary rather than leaking the IPC contract).
export interface StorageEntry
{
    Name:        string
    IsDirectory: boolean
}

// Explorer-tree ordering for a directory listing: folders before files, each
// group alphabetical (case-insensitive, then case-sensitive to stay stable).
// A `List` result is unordered/backend-dependent, so tree builders sort through
// this to present a consistent VSCode-style ordering.

// The universal storage contract. Every backend must satisfy this. All paths
// are project-relative; `Root` is an opaque, human-readable descriptor of where
// the storage is rooted (an absolute OS folder locally, a container id/URL
// remotely) — for display/diagnostics only, never parsed or joined.

// a disk-backed store can honor. Consumers feature-test with isLocalFileAccess
// before using it; a cloud backend omits it and the affordance disables itself.
